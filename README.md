# Project Purpose and Aims
The main reason for creating this project is to improve my knowledge of conventions and getting into the habit of following them. I eventually want to try and get a degree apprenticeship in software development, and by learning industry conventions, it may improve my chances of getting one as well as making it easier for me to start working with a team of developers if I manage to get one. My previous projects did not really follow any industry conventions (although I was to some extent following my own that I had naturally started doing and what I had been taught at GCSEs and A-levels). Below is a list summarising the conventions I want to follow.

- Python Convention - PEP8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Git Commit Message Convention - Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- README Template - (https://github.com/JoshuaBilsland/my-conventions)
